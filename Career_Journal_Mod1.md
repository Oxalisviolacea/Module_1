### Module 1 Pre-work

**1. When you've worked towards a goal in the past, what systems or tools have been helpful for you in accomplishing that goal? How could you adapt those same systems/tools to use while at Turing?**
  - Teaching others the material helps solidify past concepts
    - Adaptation: respond to comments in the slack channel when classmates ask for help
  - Reviewing my notes
    - Adaptation: use the cornell method and write summaries and follow-up questions after classes
    - Adaptation: establish an organized files structure in google docs
  - Creating a study space that's free of distractions
      - Adaptation: keep my phone and laptop on 'do not disturb' while I'm in class
      - Adaptation: don't multi-task during class time. If something comes to mind, write it on my to-do list
  - Writing in my bullet journal keeps me organized and on-task
      - Adaptation: find a way to use both my bullet journal and my google calendar
  - Repitition/building muscle memory
      - Adaptation: make flashcards  
      
**2. As you start this new career, what is one of your strengths and how do you know?**   
I have quite a bit of experience in data collection, analysis, visualization, and interpretation. I've collected, entered, and performed quality control queries on both small and large ecological datasets. I've also analyzed the data and made models to write reccomendations for land management treatments, such as prescribed fire and forest thinning. While I've mainly worked with scientific data, I think my experience would translate well to back-end engineering. Furthermore, I have quite a bit of experience in data visualization, especially maps and graphs, and I can communicate complex concepts to a general audience.  

**3. Describe how you work best (conditions, environment, preferences, etc.):**  
I've spent most of my professional career working as part of small team, so I really enjoy group assignments. I also like working with my hands and I don't necessarily do well sitting in front of a computer for long periods of time, so taking breaks is important. I plan to use the pompedoro method and keep my phsysical and digital spaces organized. I also like drinking tea, using my happy light, getting up to walk around or socialize during my breaks. 

**4. As you start this new career, what is your greatest area of improvement when it comes to your professional skills?**
Other than some poor time management skills, I haven't had the opportunity to develop some of the profession skills that my peers in the private sector have. I've never had to bargin for a salary or ask for a raise. I've also never really networked or used social media. I choose Turing because I knew that you also focus on soft skills, so I'm looking forward to the professional development series.  

**5. How will developing a deeper understanding of your strengths and working preferences benefit you as a software developer?**  
Developing good habits and efficient workflows will benefit me throughout my career! Additionally, a strong understanding of my strengths and weeknesses will give me a baseline for further career development. With this understanding, I'll be able to seek out opportunities to challenge myself and use the skills I've already acquired throughout my professional career.

**6.Describe the vision you currently have for your career after Turing:**  
I would like to work for a start-up, small business, or nonprofit. A start-up or small business would allow me to be a valuble member of a close-knit team. My background is ecology, or more broadly environmental management, so I would also enjoy working for a nonprofit. Working with smaller organizations might also allow me to work full-stack and I think I would enjoy the challenge. I also like working with big datasets and I have a little bit of experience making models, so I think I would also be content working for a mid-size company if I could specialize in data analysis. I would like to work remotely or for a company in California- hopefully I'll be able to meet some of the alumni working in that area.

## Module 1
### Week 1: Understanding your strengths  

1. Describe one of your strengths
**- What is something you have learned to do well (list a skill)?**  
I can think at a systems scale and I work well as part of a team.
**- What is something you know about (list some knowledge/expertise you have)?**  
I know statistics, cartography, and ecology.
**- What is something you have a natural ability to do well (list a talent)?**
I am curious, teachable, and I'm a good leader.

2. Read through your Top 4 results from Pairin
**- In your own words, what do these top 4 qualities tell you about yourself?**  
  - Imaginative-Inspirational: Influenced by the outside word and attuned to mood, aesthetics, and emotions. Sees the big picture.
  - Microscope: Sensitive, gentle, and introspective.
  - Glass window: Authentic and unbothered by internal descrepencies.
  - Lover of moderation: Gives others the benefit of the doubt and doesn't want to rock the boat.
**- Do they resonate with you? Why/why not?**
  - Imaginative-Inspirational: This describes me perfectly!
  - Microscope: This is accurate.
  - Glass window: I think this is also accurate.
  - Lover of moderation: This is true, but I'm also apt to speak my mind.
**- How do they relate to the strength you wrote about in Prompt #1?**
I don't think it covered my analytical side or my initiative.
3. Challenges with strengths
**- What can make it challenging to recognize your strengths? How can you work through those challenges?**
It's difficult to see yourself from others perspectives.
**- Do you ever see yourself overusing certain strengths? In what circumstances would you want to use them less and amplify other strengths? How could you adjust your approach in those instances?**
Many of my skills aren't applicable to software development, so I could emphasize some of the things ecology and cartography has taught me.
4. Strengths in action
**- Write 1-2 sentences describing how you like to work (i.e., Do you pre-plan? Do you talk through your ideas first? Do you work better with deadlines? How do you stay organized?** 
I work well with deadlines, I like talking through my ideas, and visually brainstorming or making outlines. I use my bullet journal to stay organized, but my digital files aren't organized.
**- How could you describe these working preferences to your project teammates? Your mentor? Your instructors?**
I don't know the working preferences for any of these people yet.
**- What would you need to be aware of when working with people who have different strengths from you?**
Having different strengths from me is ideal! Give everyone an opportunity to let their strengths shine.
**- How could your Pairin results help you better understand your everyday working preferences?**
5. Continued growth
**- Is there any particular strength you’d like to sharpen while you’re at Turing? Any area you consider a weakness that you’d like to strengthen?88
**- What are some steps you could take here?**
**- How could you be aware of progress you’re making?**
