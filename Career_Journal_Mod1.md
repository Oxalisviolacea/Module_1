### Module 1 Pre-work

**1. When you've worked towards a goal in the past, what systems or tools have been helpful for you in accomplishing that goal? How could you adapt those same systems/tools to use while at Turing?**
  - Teaching others the material helps solidify past concepts
    - Adaptation: respond to comments in the slack channel when classmates ask for help
  - Reviewing my notes
    - Adaptation: learn the cornell method and write summaries and follow-up questions after classes
    - Adaptation: establish an organized files structure in google docs
  - Creating a study space that's free of distractions
      - Adaptation: keep my phone and laptop on 'do not disturb' while I'm in class
      - Adaptation: don't multi-task during class time. If something comes to mind, write it on my to-do list
  - Writing in my bullet journal keeps me organized and on-task
      - Adaptation: find a way to use both my bullet journal and my google calendar
  - Repitition/building muscle memory
      - Adaptation: make flashcards  
      
**2. As you start this new career, what is one of your strengths and how do you know?**   
I have quite a bit of experience in data collection, analysis, visualization, and interpretation. I've collected, entered, and performed quality control queries on both small and large ecological dataset. I've also analyzed the data, made models, maps, and graphs, to make reccomendations to inform land management decisions.

**3. Describe how you work best (conditions, environment, preferences, etc.):**  
I work best as part of a team. I also like working with my hands and I don't necessarily do well sitting in front of a computer for long periods of time. I plan to use the pompedoro method and go on a walk on during my lunch/dinner break to help me stay focused.  

**4. As you start this new career, what is your greatest area of improvement when it comes to your professional skills?**
I have a bad habit of prcrastinating and I need to improve my time management skills in general. I've also never had to bargin for a salary or ask for a raise, so I'm excited to learn more about that in our professional development series.

**5. How will developing a deeper understanding of your strengths and working preferences benefit you as a software developer?**  
Developing good habits early on will help me later in my career! I'm going to try and establish a routine and set up my workspace prior to starting Module 1.

**6.Describe the vision you currently have for your career after Turing:**  
I would like to work for a start-up, small business, or nonprofit. A start-up or small business would allow me to be a valuble member of a close-knit team. My background is ecology, or more broadly environmental management, so I would also enjoy working for a nonprofit. Unfortunately, I've acquired a large amount of student loan debt over the years, so I'm looking for a position where my salary will be high enough to start paying off some of my debt. Ideally, I'd like to work for an organization that aligns with my interests and values that compensates me fairly.
